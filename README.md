# ExtremeSportsSOS
Simple android app, that detects when you are not moving for longer period of time and sends an SOS message with your coordinates to defined contact

## Why?
This project was created to show how to use [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) in not-so-trivial example. Developed in [Kotlin](kotlinlang.org), using [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter) for presentation and repository pattern for data access. There is also a little bit of [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) where it made sense to use it. [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger) was used for dependency injection.  
  
This is by no means a "reference implementation" that rigorously follows all the rules. It's rather a real-life example with pragmatic approach.
